# *Abstract*
Microwave oven system is an indispensable electric appliance in modern kitchen that heats, bakes or cooks the food by exposing it with electromagnetic radiation.The microwave oven has input buttons for selecting Cooking Time, Start, Minute Plus, Time of Day, and Cancel, as well as a numeric keypad. It also has a display to show the cooking time left and time of day. In addition, the oven has a microwave heating element for cooking the food, a door sensor to sense when the door is open, and a weight sensor to detect if there is an item in the oven. Cooking is only permitted when the door is closed and when there is something in the oven. The oven has several actuators. Besides the heating element, there are light, beeper, and turntable actuators.

# *Applications of microwave oven*

The microwave oven uses less energy than a cook stove if it cooks or reheats small amounts of food. Microwave oven uses much less space in the kitchen and is perfect for those with limited living space.

# *Objectives:*

1. Development of a microcontroller based Electric Oven with Recipe, time and temperature control 
2. Development  of  a  code  for  microcontroller  in  C programming language 
3. Development  of  oven  controller  with  high  grade accuracy

# *Requirements*

## **For real components:**

    Micro-controller.
    Keypad.
    4*16 LCD.
    Heater.
    Lamp.
    Motor.
    Buzzer.
    3 Buttons (Start, Stop, and Power Off Button).
    Door and Weight Sensor.

## **For simulation:**

    Proteus and simulate the whole needed circuits.


## **High level requiremens**

 1. The microwave oven shall be simple in operation and with turnable.
 2. The system shall be able to cook in limited time frame.
 3. The system shall have variable Heat Settings
 4. Low Energy Consumption
 5. The system should not Change the Taste And Nutrition

 
## **Low level requiremens**

1.  The system should be easy to clean.
2.  The system should be Safe For Children. 


## **Use of actuators and sensors**

1. Microwave oven which is suitable to execute a precise cooking control by detecting the radiant         temperature of the food surface by a remote sensor and compensating the distance between the food and sensor.
2. A conventional microwave oven detects the cooking status by using a temperature detecting sensor, wetness detecting sensor, vapor detecting sensor or weight detecting sensor, and executes an automatic cooking therethrough.
3. In order to execute a cooking by detecting an optimum cooking status, as one of cooking methods by a radiant temperature detection of a food, a detection method using an infrared sensor and cooking control using the same
